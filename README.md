# BrownLegoCSS

This is a Go-based replacement for YUICompressor's CSS compressor.  This version seems to offer significant performance improvements over the original Java version, mostly due to it being compiled to native code, and also being able to compress/minify the contents of multiple files simultaneously through Go's awesome concurrency features.  However, there is probably a lot that can still be done in order to improve performance further, so please feel free to fork, improve, and submit pull requests!

## Name

Weird name, right?  Our inspiration for it comes from the GIF at [https://static.fjcdn.com/gifs/Star_c7b4a0_1903495.gif](https://static.fjcdn.com/gifs/Star_c7b4a0_1903495.gif) ;-)
